How do you represent [natural language](NLP.md) as numbers? Machine learning models can only accept numbers as inputs, which is relatively simple to accomplish with [Computer Vision](Computer%20Vision.md) as we just use the RGB values of a picture, but what about English words?

The naive solution is one-hot encoding, but this is extremely sparse, and doesn't provide any information on the meaning of the words.
