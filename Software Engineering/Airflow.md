*Orchestration* of tasks is critical in software, especially in data engineering and [Machine Learning](../Machine%20Learning/ML%20Engineering/Preprocessing.md). *Airflow* is the most popular open source orchestration software used largely to orchestrate data transformations and other actions in a [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](../Data%20Structures%20&%20Algorithms/Data%20Structures/Graphs.md). By running everything in a DAG, we can ensure there are no cycles and tasks are completed in the order we want, preventing race conditions.
