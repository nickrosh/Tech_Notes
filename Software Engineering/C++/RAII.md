*Resource Allocation Is Initialization* is a programming technique whereby resource use its tied to the lifetime of objects with [automatic duration](Scope,%20Duration,%20&%20Linkage.md) (e.g. non-dynamically allocated objects). In C++, RAII is implemented via [classes](C++%20OOP.md) with constructors and destructors. Additionally, we ensure that all remaining [Dynamically allocated memory](../C/Dynamic%20Memory%20Allocation.md) is managed by classes that will automatically clean it up when destroyed. This is why [Smart Pointers](Smart%20Pointers.md) are so much more desirable that allocating the memory directly.

#### Memory Leaks

When a pointer to some memory is lost for whatever reason, that memory is pretty much lost to the developer. There is no way to recover it and furthermore, that memory is locked and can't be used until the program is terminated. This problem is so pervasive, we accept the significant performance hit of [garbage collectors](../../Electrical%20&%20Computer%20Engineering/Systems/Garbage%20Collection.md) to clean up unused memory.
