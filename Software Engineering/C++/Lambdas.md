*Lambdas* or anonymous functions allow us to define a function within another function. The nesting is important, as it allows us both to avoid namespace naming pollution, and to define the function as close to where it is used as possible (providing additional context). The syntax for lambdas are pretty alien:

`[captureClause] (parameters) -> returnType {statements}`
