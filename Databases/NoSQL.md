There has been many new paradigms of database technology, these new ideas outside of the classic [Relational Databases](Relational%20Databases.md) are collectively called Not Only SQL, better known as NoSQL. The paradigms are as follows:


### [Document Databases](Document%20Databases.md)
JSON-like document style storage, actually saved as [BSON](../Internet%20&%20Networking/Serialization.md) encoding that allows binary types.
Example: **MongoDB**

### Column-Oriented DB
Column storage database.
Example: **Cassandra**

### Graph DB
Storing data as a [Graph](../Data%20Structures%20&%20Algorithms/Data%20Structures/Graphs.md).
Example: **Neo4J**

### Key-Value DB
Storing data in key-value pairs, like a non-volatile [Hash Map](../Data%20Structures%20&%20Algorithms/Data%20Structures/Hash%20Maps.md).
Example: **Redis**
