There has been many new paradigms of database technology, these new ideas outside of the classic [Relational DB](Relational%20DB.md) are collectively called Not Only SQL, better known as NoSQL. The paradigms are as follows:


### [Document DB](Document%20DB.md)
JSON-like document style storage, similar to [Serialized](Serialization.md) data sent via [HTTP](HTTP.md).
Example: **MongoDB**

### Column-Oriented DB
Column storage database.
Example: **Cassandra**

### Graph DB
Storing data as a [Graph](Graphs.md).
Example: **Neo4J**

### Key-Value DB
Storing data in key-value pairs, like a non-volatile [Hash Map](Hash%20Maps.md).
