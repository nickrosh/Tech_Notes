A *signal* is electronics is simply a voltage that changes with time in a particular way.

## Sinusoidal Signals

*Sine Waves* are the most common signals in electronics. [AC Current](../Electricity.md) is a 60Hz sine wave. A great merit of sine waves are that they are the solutions to certain linear differential equations that happen to describe many phenomena in nature as well as the properties of linear circuits. A [linear circuit](../Electric%20Circuit.md) driven by a sine wave always responds with a sine wave, although in general the phase and amplitude change. No other periodic signal can make this statement. Mathematically, the voltage of a sine wave can be described by
$$V = Asin(2\pi f t)$$
Where 'A' is the amplitude and 'f' is the frequency in hertz.
