*Impedance* is the opposition to [alternating current](../Electricity.md), there is both a real component as we know as [resistance](Resistors.md) and a complex component we call *reactance*. Impedance possesses both magnitude and phase, unlike resistance which only has magnitude.

## Phase

The phase between voltage and current is dictated by the [Capacitors](Capacitors.md) and [Inductors](Inductors.md) in the circuit. They have a purely reactive impedance and cause a phase shift in the current

Inductive loads cause a 90 degree shift of the current in front of the voltage. Capacitive loads are the opposite and cause voltage to be 90 degrees in front of current. This ratio of actual power versus reactive power from the phase shift is called the *power factor*.
