*Electricity* is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. By convention, an electron has negative charge -e and a proton has positive charge +e.  The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.

Electricity is at the heart of electronics and modern industrial society. There are a vast array of fields involving electricity, but this article will mainly concern its application in electronics.

We measure electric power in *Watts*, electric current in *Amperes* and electric potential difference in *Volts*. The electric power in watts produces by an electric current ( I ) consisting of charge *Q* coulombs every *t* seconds passing through an electric potential difference of *V* is:

$P = VI$

In simpler terms, in a static field, power equals current times voltage.

## Direct Current (DC)

Direct current is a one-directional flow of electric charge. There is no frequency element to the current, as contrasted with alternating current. All electronics are powered by direct current.

## Alternating Current (AC)

*Alternating Current* is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time. AC has a frequency element unlike DC. The usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave, whose positive half-period corresponds with positive directions of the current and vice versa. Most Analog [Signals](Signals.md) are sine waves and thus alternating current. [Radio Frequency](Analog/Radio%20Frequency.md) signals carried on electrical wires are another example of alternating current at a much higher frequency.

AC is mostly used for Power Transmission and Distribution, and powering homes and industrial applications like motors. AC voltage can be converted much more easily than DC, which requires advanced [Power Electronics](Analog/Power%20Electronics.md). AC voltage can be easily changed with transformers. Which take advantage of the simple electromagnetic properties of alternating current. A changing current (AC) creates a magnetic field, which can then be used to induce another current in another wire.

Here is a representation of long distance electric power transmission. G = Power generator, almost always a steam turbine, whether you're burning coal, gas, or uranium. U = Step up transformer to high voltage transmission lines. R = [resistance](Analog/Resistors.md) of transmission line, Pw = power lost in the line. I = Current in the line, Pt = Power entering the line, and Pe = power reaching the end of the line. D = step down transformer, and lastly C = consumers.
