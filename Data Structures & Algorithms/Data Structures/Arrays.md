The simplest data structure, yet also very powerful. An array is simply a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same data type together, which makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to the base value. Because the array elements are tied to a location in memory, you can have constant time data access if you know the exact index you are looking for.
