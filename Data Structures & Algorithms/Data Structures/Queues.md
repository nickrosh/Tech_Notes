Linear Data Structure similar to [Stacks](Stacks.md) that follows a FIFO (First In, First Out) scheme. The primary functions are as follows:

- Enqueue: add an item to the rear of the queue
- Dequeue: remove the item at the front of the queue
- Is_Empty: checks to see if the queue is empty
- Peek: gets the value of the front element without removing it from the queue
