Backtracking is a Brute-Force algorithm that involves searching every possible combination with [Depth First Search](Depth%20First%20Search.md) and grabbing results based on a base condition. Backtracking is generally not used as it has exponential [Time & Space Complexity](Time%20&%20Space%20Complexity.md).
