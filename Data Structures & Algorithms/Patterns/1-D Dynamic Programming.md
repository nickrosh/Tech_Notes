## Palindrome Substrings

The easiest way to get Palindrome substrings in a string is to iterate through the word and search starting at every letter. For every character, use [Two Pointers](Two%20Pointers.md) and check if the letter to the left and the letter to the right are equal. If they are then you have a palindrome and you can continue the while loop

You must do this for both Even and Odd palindromes. For the odd case at letter index = i, simply set left = i and right = i. For the even case: left = i and right = i + 1.
