Linear Data Structure similar to [[Queues]] that follows a FILO (First In, Last Out) scheme. The primary functions are as follows:

- Push: add an item to the top of the stack
- Pop: remove the item from the top of the stack
- Is_Empty: checks to see if the stack is empty
- Peek: gets the value of the top element without removing it from the stack
