Welcome to my notes. This encompasses my learnings from College, to work, to mostly self-study. My goal is to have this one day be a high-quality knowledge base of everything I've learned across all parts of the technology space. An interesting trend is that I write a lot more about subjects that are new to me (e.g. Databases) than subjects I already know (EE). 1/17/23 word count = 45,545

My goal is to have high quality articles, written by me, of everything from sand to NAND, to Chrome, to the AI that would write this better than me.
