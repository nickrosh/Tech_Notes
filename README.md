Welcome to my notes. This encompasses my learnings from College, to work, to mostly self-study. My goal is to have this one day be a high-quality knowledge base of everything I've learned across all parts of the technology space.

My goal is to have high quality articles, written by me, of everything from sand to NAND, to Chrome, to the AI that would write this better than me.
