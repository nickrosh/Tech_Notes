Welcome to my notes. This encompasses my learnings from college, to work, to self-study. My goal is to have this one day be a high-quality knowledge base of everything I've learned across all parts of the technology space. I will not write about legacy or historical technology, only those that have contemporary usage. 1/17/23 word count = 45,545

The end state should have high-quality articles of everything from sand to NAND, to Tetris, to Chrome, to the AI that would write this better than me.
