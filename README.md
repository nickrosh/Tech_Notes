Welcome to my Tech notes. My goal is to have this one day be a high-quality knowledge base of everything I've learned across all parts of the computer technology space. I will not write about legacy or historical technology, only those that have contemporary usage. Note that this is made to be my personal notes, meaning there may be gaps of information that are obvious to me but not to another reader e.g. programming 101 topics.
1/24/23 word count = 57,656

The end state should have high-quality articles of everything from sand to NAND, to Tetris, to Chrome, to the AI that would write this better than me.
